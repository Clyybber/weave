# Global / inter-thread communication channels

type
  ComChannels* = object
    ## Communication channels
    ## This is a global objects and so must be stored
    ## at a global place.
    # - Nim seq uses thread-local heaps
    #   and are not recommended.
    # - ptr UncheckedArray would work
    #   however there is pointer indirection so cache misses
    #   and they may be scattered on the heap so locality issue.
    # - the best is to have them as global unitialized array
    #   so they are stored on the BSS segmend
    #   (no storage used just size + fixed memory offset)
    #   however this requires a known max number of workers
