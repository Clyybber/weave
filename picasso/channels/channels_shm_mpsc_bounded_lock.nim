type
  ChannelShmMpscBoundedLock*[T] = object
    ## Lock-based multi-producer single-consumer channel
    ##
    ## Properties:
    ##   - Lock-based
    ##   - no modulo operations
    ##   - memory-efficient: buffer the size of the capacity
    ##   - Padded to avoid false sharing
    ##   - No extra indirection to access the item
    ##   - Linearizable (?)
    ##
    ## Usage:
    ##   When producer wait/sleep is not an issue as they don't have
    ##   useful work to do.
    ##
    ## At the moment, only trivial objects can be received or sent
    ## (no GC, can be copied and no custom destructor)
    ##
    ## The content of the channel is not destroyed upon channel destruction
    ## Destroying a channel containing ptr object will not deallocate them

    # When the difference is capacity, the queue is full.
