  IntrusiveStackable* = concept x, type T
    x is ptr
    x.next is T

  IntrusiveStack*[T: IntrusiveStackable] = object
    ## Generic intrusive stack for pointer objects
    ## Those objects should implement a "next" field
    ## that will be used for ordering by the IntrusiveStack
    ##
    ## IntrusiveStack takes ownership of the pointer object pushed into it.
    ## It expects elements to be allocated via createShared (i.e. shared-memory, not thread-local)

    # TODO: This data-structure is used for caching tasks and reuse them without
    #       stressing the Nim/system allocator.
    #       However for improved performance, an allocator
    #       that is designed for cactus stacks is probably needed.
    #       A cactus stack happens when a task (for example fibonacci)
    #       spawns N stacks, which then spawns M tasks.
    #       Then the stacks of grandchildren are:
    #         - Root 1 -> 11 -> 111
    #         - Root 1 -> 11 -> 112
    #         - Root 1 -> 12 -> 121
    #         - Root 1 -> 12 -> 122
    #       and pop-ing from those stacks doesn't translate to a linear memory pop.
    #       See memory.md in memory folder
    #
    # Also note that this never releases allocated memory, which might be an issue for
    # long running threads.
