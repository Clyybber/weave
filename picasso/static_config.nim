  ## false sharing / cache threashing / cache ping-pong
  ## Most CPU Arch (x86 and ARM) are 64 bytes.
  ## However, it has been shown that due to some Intel CPU prefetching
  ## 2 cache lines at once, 128 bytes was often necessary.
  ## Samsung Exynos CPU, Itanium, modern PowerPC and some MIPS uses 128 bytes.
  # Nim threadpool uses 32 bytes :/
